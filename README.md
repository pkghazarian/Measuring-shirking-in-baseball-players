study looks at the shirking problem that appears in long-term sports contracts

The following study looks at the shirking problem that appears in long-term sports contracts. The issue of shirking appears when a player has incentive to perform above expectations for a time period in order to secure a long-term contract, after which the playerâ€™s performance will return to normal or fall below expectations. Our paper focuses on major league baseball. We look at the free agent players that were on a contract year in 2016. A regression is ran to find the effect of the length of contract on players displaying shirking behavior. Shirking behavior is assumed when the players actual performance falls below expected performance.
